## Goals

1. Understand the **MRG32k3a** generator in **RngStreams** package 
2. Employ **RngStreams** in C++ programs parallelized via **OpenMP** and **MPI**
3. Employ **RngStreams** in R programs parallelized through the [parallel](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf) and 
[rstream](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstream/rstream.pdf) packages
